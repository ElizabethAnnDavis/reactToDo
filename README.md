# React + Vite - ToDo List App

A simple ToDo List application built with React using the `useReducer` hook for state management. This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, edit tasks directly in the list, and delete tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Type a new task in the input field and click "ADD" to include it in your list.
- **Toggle Completion:** Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed (or uncompleted). Completed tasks are visually indicated by a line-through.
- **Edit Tasks:** Click the "Edit" button to switch a task into edit mode, allowing inline editing of the task text.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list with the "Delete" button.
- **Inline Editing:** When editing a task, the edit and delete buttons are hidden, and Save/Cancel options are displayed.
- **Disabled Editing for Completed Tasks:** The edit button is disabled for completed tasks, preventing changes to finished tasks.
